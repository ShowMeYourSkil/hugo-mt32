# Welcome to mt32.net!

Did you ever had a computer related problem twice? The goal of this website is to
create writeups for every of these tricky problems related to programming, hacking (with hardware),
software in general and every other topic realted to tech. Even if there is no one else with the same problem,
I will not have to struggle twice!

There will be also other content realted to personel projects with a focus on web dev and maybe game dev too.

This blog is run by [mtorials](https://mtorials.de/) and [universum](http://universegame.de/) with occasional guest writers!
