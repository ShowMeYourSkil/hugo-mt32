### Wordpress? No!

When I first had the idea of creating a website to share my ideas and problems related to programming, I already knew of the most important rule for programmers for a long time: Don't reinvent the wheel! Of course I had heard of wordpress but I already had tried it out and neither the fact that it uses php nor the idea of selecting a simple theme for my project was a plus point for me at the time.

### Headless CMS

Because I wanted to write my own frontend or at least my own layout and style, I searched for an headless content management system (headless CMS). I also wanted to use GraphQL instead of a standard RESTful API. In retrospect this was not a very smart requirement, because my idea of a blog does not really need the benefits of GraphQL. Also it was very hard to find a production ready headless CMS with GraphQL support.
