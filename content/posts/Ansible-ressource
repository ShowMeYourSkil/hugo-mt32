# Virtualbox

Hi and welcome back to my new article, 
In this article I would like to tell you about the virtualization software of Oracle Virtualbox. 
I will deal with the issues, what it can do and how to install it.

# Why I use the Oracle Virtualbox?

I use the virtualbox to easily install virtual machines running Linux on my Windows PC. 
When I no longer need them I can simply delete them again. 
Oracle Virtualbox is the most popular and in my opinion the best virtualization software for Windows, Mac OS, Linux and Oracle Solaris.

# How to Install Oracle Virtualbox on Windows10.

Example OS: Windows 10

1. Open: `https://www.virtualbox.org/`
2. Press the big button: `Download Virtualbox 6.1`
3. Download the setup.exe file
4. Execute the Setup file
