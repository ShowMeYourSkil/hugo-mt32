                            <h1 id="multi-gpu-on-manjaro">Multi GPU on Manjaro</h1>
<p>This blog post is about how I made my multi monitor and multi gpu setup work with Manjaro Linux.</p>
<p><em>Disclamer: This is how I was able to fix this problem. This may work for others, but I can not guarantee this. This is NOT a guide!</em></p>
<h2 id="my-setup">My Setup</h2>
<p>I use a multi monitor setup with a discrete graphics card (1050ti) and an integrated Intel HD Graphics. Manjaro, the linux distribution of my choice, offers not only proprietary Nvidia drivers but also special drivers to work with Intel and Nvidia together. Features of these special drivers called &ldquo;prime&rdquo; and &ldquo;bumblebee&rdquo; are for example power savings on laptops by using Intel graphics for lighter workloads.</p>
<p>The more or less unusual thing with my setup is that I have monitors connected to both my integrated as well as my discrete card.</p>
<h2 id="where-the-problems-started">Where the Problems Started</h2>
<p>After I installed Manjaro and everything worked fine with the free drivers I installed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA">cuda</a> package and rebooted. After this only the monitors connected to the integrated graphics worked. I then installed the proprietary drivers for the Nvidia card. This did not solve the problem.</p>
<p>I went on trying different drivers. I got the to the Nvidia card connected monitors eventually to work by applying the Nvidia X server configuration with this command:</p>
<pre><code>nvidia-xconfig
</code></pre>
<p>But then the monitors connected to the integrated graphics stayed black. I thought that I might have to configure the X server myself. This <a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/how-to-add-a-second-monitor-connected-to-the-integrated-graphics-card-not-the-dedicated-one/107158">forum post</a> confirmed that.</p>
<h2 id="fixing-parts">Fixing Parts</h2>
<p>In copied the Nvidia configuration file and copied it from /etc/X11/xorg.conf to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/, renamed the old file so that it would not take any effect and modified the new one.</p>
<pre><code>sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/myconfig.conf
sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.old
sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/myconfig.conf
</code></pre>
<p>I copied the &ldquo;Device&rdquo; section and then edited it to make it look like this:</p>
<pre><code>Section &quot;Device&quot;
    Identifier     &quot;Device1&quot;
    Driver         &quot;intel&quot;
    VendorName     &quot;Intel Corporation&quot;
    BusID          &quot;PCI:00:02.0&quot;
EndSection
</code></pre>
<p>I found the bus ID of the Intel graphics with the command:</p>
<pre><code>inxi -Fx
</code></pre>
<p>I now had two devices in my xorg config. And this was the fix!</p>
<p>Sometimes you have to also enable the monitors. I was able to do this with the graphical tool in Manjaro, but you should be able to use xrandr for this.</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>If you want to know whether your second device (graphics (card)) is detected or not, you can use</p>
<pre><code> xrandr --listproviders
</code></pre>
<h2 id="problems-remaining">Problems Remaining</h2>
<p>I sadly was not able to rotate my monitor connected to the integrated graphics. It resulted in inconsistent and strange behavior while not filling the screen space with content. I eventually &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; this by rotating the monitor back to its normal rotation.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Windows handles it better&hellip;&hellip; But maybe this was still helpful for you! If not, it will be helpful the next time I install Manjaro.</p>

                            Web technologies are getting more and more complex. This is how I found my way to this blog.
                        </p>

<h2 id="wordpress-no">Wordpress? No!</h2>
<p>When I first had the idea of creating a website to share my ideas and problems related to programming, I already knew of the most important rule for programmers for a long time: Don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel! Of course I had heard of wordpress but I already had tried it out and neither the fact that it uses PHP nor the idea of selecting a simple theme for my project was a plus point for me at the time.</p>
<h2 id="headless-cmss">Headless CMSs</h2>
<p>Because I wanted to write my own frontend or at least my own layout and style, I searched for an headless content management system (headless CMS). I also wanted to use GraphQL instead of a standard RESTful API. In retrospect this was not a very smart requirement, because my idea of a blog does not really need the benefits of GraphQL. Also it was very hard to find a production ready headless CMS with GraphQL support. After trying various CMSs without ever being happy with one I decided that it can not be so hard to write my own backend.</p>
<h2 id="reinventing-the-wheel">Reinventing the Wheel</h2>
<p>At this point I knew I was writing everything myself. This normally never is the best solution for any given problem that already has been solved thousands of times (in case of blog., But I thought I would maybe learn something along the way and have some fun writing my blog.</p>
<h2 id="version-one">Version One</h2>
<p>The first and finished version of this page was a overengineered website with login, comment section and menus. Written in TypeScript with Node and Prisma, a language and framework I do not know well, as well as Vue for the frontend, the software ran but the codebase was more than ugly. But I was using a GraphQL API!</p>
<p>Ok, I was not actually using it. After programming this for months I tried to deploy it and I failed. I did not know how to use docker properly but I had to use it for Prisma and the database. Also setting up my node project for deployment on my virtual server (VPS) was harder then I thought it would be. The extra step from TypeScript to JavaScript did not help there either.</p>
<h2 id="hugo">Hugo</h2>
<p>After too much frustration about not being able to easily deploy an already finished website I suspended this project. I never liked the idea of using the JavaScript ecosystem and my terrible code for the final website anyway. But I did not plan on giving up completely.</p>
<p>When I discovered Hugo by coincidence I was interested, because it neither is a CMS in the traditional way nor has it the need for an API and JavaScript/AJAX on the frontend to work. It instead is a static side generator. It renders the whole website before you deploy it. That does mean that static side generator are not suited for use cases in which you have to update your content regularly. But in case of a blog this not necessary. You only have to deploy the website when you post something new.</p>
<p>Also Hugo does not rely on the JavaScript ecosystem and to write my own theme I only had to learn a few lines of the Go HTML Templating Language and not a whole JavaScript framework.</p>
<h2 id="continuous-deployment">Continuous Deployment</h2>
<p>Having to upload the newly rendered website via FTP every time you change something is a bit tedious and an argument against a solution like this. But when I learned Netlify has an integration for Hugo I decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>Netlify is a tool to deploy websites easily. You just have to connect it to a Git repository, done. After logging in with my already existing GitHub account I was able to deploy my Hugo website I made with exactly two commands a few minutes earlier. And on every commit Netlify builds and updates the website. Although I really like my VPS running Nginx I found this way of getting your own website up stunningly fast and easy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fastes way to build the fastest sites</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&hellip;was not an overstatement by Netlify in my case. Especially together with Hugo, the</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The world’s fastest framework for building websites.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="conculsion">Conculsion</h2>
<p>Eventually I sticked to this method and I am very happy about it. The integration with GitHub is great and works like a universal interface to work together with other apps like <a href="https://forestry.io/">Forestry</a>. It is super convenient! I can write new articles with every device and the chages will be online only second later. There are definitely other solutions that can work better in other use cases, but for me this seems like the best one!</p>
<h2 id="update">Update</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m running this blog on my VPS now automaticly build and deployed with the Gitlab CI.</p>
